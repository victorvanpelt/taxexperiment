        Telecom Co. is a company headquartered in Country A which has a tax rate of 24%.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the taxes Telecom Co. effectively pays in Country A may be lower than the tax rate of 24%.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Telecom Co. can use investment tax credits to deduct the amount they invest in business operations in Country A from the taxes they have to pay based on the tax rate of 24%.
        </li>

        <li>
            Telecom Co. can also shift profits from Country A to Country B, which has a tax rate of 5%, by using gaps and mismatches between the tax systems of Country A and Country B, which creates a tax difference due to foreign profits.
        </li>

            Telecom Co. can also shift profits from Country A to Country B, which has a tax rate of 0%, by using gaps and mismatches between the tax systems of Country A and Country B, which creates a tax difference due to foreign profits.
