    <li>
        Your task is to evaluate whether two very similar, publicly-listed firms, (<b>Alophonica</b> and <b>Bellico</b>), are paying their fair share of taxes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The country in which both firms are headquartered, <b>Olmeos</b>, has a statutory tax rate of <b>24%</b>. However, the tax that firms effectively pay in Olmeos may be different from the statutory tax rate of <b>24%</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are two ways that firms can lower their <b>effective tax rates</b>:
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Firms may use business tax credits offered by the government of <b>Olmeos</b>.
            </li>
<!--            <li>-->
<!--                They may offset their taxes using losses in prior years.-->
<!--            </li>-->
            <li>
                Firms may shift their profits using gaps and mismatches between different countries' tax systems to countries with lower statutory tax rates.
