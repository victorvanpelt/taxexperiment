    <li>
        There are two firms called (<b>Alophonica</b> and <b>Bellico</b>).
    <li>
        Both firms operate in the telecommunications industry and have similar opertions in two countries: <b>Olmeos</b> and <b>Hingland</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You are asked to evaluate whether those firms are paying their fair share in taxes.
    </li>
    <li>
        In Olmeos firms have to pay a <b>statutory tax rate</b> of 24%. In Hingland firms have to pay a <b>statutory tax rate</b> of 10%.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>effective tax rate</b> that firms pay may deviate from the statutory tax rate. There are two ways in which firms can lower their effective tax payments:
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Firms may use investment tax credits offered by the government of <b>Olmeos</b>. That is, for every dollar of qualified investments, firms may lower their tax payment by a dollar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Firms may shift their expenses using gaps and mismatches between the two tax systems to countries with higher statutory tax rates (= profit shifting).
            </li>
        </ul>
