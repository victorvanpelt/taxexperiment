    <li>
        In this study, we ask you to evaluate the ethicality of tax practices of two publically-listed firms in the country Olmeos.
    </li>
    <li>
        Although Olmeos has a statutory tax rate, the tax that firms effectively pay may be different.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are a range of ways that firms' effective tax rates may be different than the statutory tax rate in Olmeos:
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Firms may use business tax credits offered by the government of Olmeos.
            </li>
            <li>
                They may offset their taxes using losses in prior years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Firms may have operations in countries that have other statutory tax rates.
            </li>
        </ul>
