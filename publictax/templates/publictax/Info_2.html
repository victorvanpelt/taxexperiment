<!--    The taxes which firms effectively pay may be different than the <b>statutory tax rate</b> in <b>Olmeos</b>.-->
<!--</li>-->
<li>
    Firms can use two methods to lower the taxes they effectively:
</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                They can use investment tax credits offered by the government of <b>Olmeos</b>, meaning that every dollar of investment for business operations in <b>Olmeos</b> lowers the taxes they effectively pay there by one dollar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Firms may also shift their profits from <b>Olmeos</b> to <b>Hingland</b>, where the statutory tax rate is lower, by exploiting gaps and mismatches between the two countries' tax systems.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Please evaluate the following statements.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The more investments a firm makes for business operations in <b>Olmeos</b>, the less taxes it effectively pays in <b>Olmeos</b>.
        {% formfield player.Instr2a label=None %}

    <p>
        Next to using investment tax credits offered by the government of <b>Olmeos</b>, firms can also lower the taxes they effectively pay by shifting profits from <b>Olmeos</b> to <b>Hingland</b>.
