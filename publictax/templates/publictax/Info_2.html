        Although the statutory tax rate in Olmeos is 24%, the tax rate Alophonica effectively pays in Olmeos may be lower because of different reasons.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Alophonica may use investment tax credits offered by the government of Olmeos, meaning that every dollar of investment for business operations in Olmeos lowers the taxes they effectively pay by one dollar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Alophonica may also shift its profits from Olmeos to Hingland, which is a country with a statutory tax rate of 5%. Alophonica could create a foreign rate differential by using gaps and mismatches between the tax systems of Olmeos and Hingland.
    </li>
    </ul>

        <b>Please evaluate the following two statements.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The more investments Alophonica makes for business operations in Olmeos, the less taxes it effectively pays in Olmeos.

    </p>
    <p>
        Next to using investment tax credits offered by the government of Olmeos, Alophonica may also pay less taxes in Olmeos by shifting profits from Olmeos to a low tax country, creating a foreign rate differential.
