        Although the statutory tax rate in Olmeos is 24%, the tax rate Alophonica effectively pays in Olmeos may be lower.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Alophonica may use investment tax credits offered by the government of Olmeos, meaning that every dollar of investment for business operations in Olmeos lowers the taxes they effectively pay by one dollar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Alophonica may also shift its profits from Olmeos to another country with lower statutory tax rate such as Hingland, which is known to be a tax haven. Alophonica could create a foreign rate differential by using gaps and mismatches between the two countries' tax systems.

        Next to using investment tax credits offered by the government of Olmeos, Alophonica may also pay less tax in Olmeos by shifting profits from Olmeos to another low tax country, such as Hingland.
