    <p>Airline operators Statjet and Flightstar are the two main airline operators in the country Wayland. Both
        companies started operations one year ago and are similar in terms of fleet size, scope of operations, and
        countries of destination. Statjet and Flightstar are headquartered in Wayland but operate and have flights to
        and from four countries: Wayland, Luthong, Arberg, and Solland. Both firms form a group that has a subsidiary
        in every country. This year both companies are doing well, and low oil prices have boosted their profits. Last
        year was more difficult for both firms as oil prices were very high. Flightstar made a large loss (1,450 Wayland
        Guilders) in its Wayland subsidiary due to the very high oil prices, in the other countries Flightstar made
        small profits. Statjet, instead, hedged their oil-related risk against potential loss and was able to make a
        small profit in all countries.</p>

    <p>The statutory corporate tax rate in Wayland is 30%. The tax rates in the other countries are: Luthong (35%),
        Arberg (25%), and Solland (2%). All countries use loss carryforward systems. A loss carryforward is a provision
        that allows a business to use a net operating loss in one year to offset a profit in one or more of the
        following years.</p>
